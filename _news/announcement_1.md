Worked on a project on evaluating the effectiveness of
code-generation models on Hinglish Prompts under the guidance of  <a href = "https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/prof-viraj-kumar/">Prof Viraj Kumar</a>. This work resulted in publication of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-84391-4_2">HinglishEval: Evaluating the Effectiveness of
Code-generation Models on Hinglish Prompts</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am currently a third-year undergraduate (rising junior) pursuing a <strong>B.Tech in Mathematics and Computing</strong> at the <strong>Indian Institute of Science (IISc)</strong>, Bengaluru. My current GPA (till end of semester 4) is <strong>9.3/10.0</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My research interests lie in <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>, with a focus on Stochastic Approximation methods and establishing theoretical guarantees for learning algorithms, as well as in <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, particularly in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. I have practical experience training Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms across a range of environments, including Atari, MuJoCo, MiniGrid, and others. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, I have contributed to peer-reviewed publications submitted to top-tier venues and bring a strong theoretical grounding, supported by <a href ="/iisc-course-summary/">advanced coursework</a> and rigorous, <a href="/projects/">application-driven research projects</a>. </p>

My core technical expertise spans across - 
<ul>
         <li><u>Core Tools:</u> Python, PyTorch, Git, LaTeX, Docker.</li>
         <li><u>Reinforcement Learning:</u> Gym, Stable-Baselines3, TRL (HuggingFace).</li>
         <li><u>Computer Vision:</u> OpenCV, Transformers (HuggingFace), Diffusers.</li>
         <li><u>General:</u> TensorBoard, WandB, CUDA, Linux/Unix proficiency.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For details, please refer to <a href="/skills/">skills</a> section</p>

Notable co-curricular activities are -
<ul>
         <li>I am a senior core committee member of <a href ="https://databased.csa.iisc.ac.in/">Databased</a>, the IISc UG computer science club. </li>
         <li>I am a co-convener of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rhythmica.iisc/">Rhythmica</a> â€“ the IISc music club.</li>. I would like to highlight here that music is my passion. Please check out <a href="/passion/"> passion </a> for details on the same.

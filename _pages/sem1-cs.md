            Part 1: Introduction to Python - Implementation, testing and debugging of elementary algorithms in Python involving operators and expressions, basic data types (integers, floats, Booleans, strings, lists), variables (references vs. objects), assignments, conditionals, iteration, functions, recursion, and modules. <br><br> Part 2: Basic Algorithms and Data Structures - Implementation of iterative algorithms (linear and binary search, string matching, iterative sorting algorithms, etc.) and recursive algorithms (exponentiation, recursive sorting, etc.). Introduction to asymptotic analysis. Big O notation. Recursive relations. Arrays versus Linked lists. Improving running times of algorithms using appropriate data structures such as hash tables, binary search trees, heaps, etc. Simple graph algorithms (shortest path, minimal spanning tree). <br><br> Part 3: Introduction to C - Differences between C and Python with respect to syntax and semantics (basic data types: integers, C arrays vs. Python lists, and strings; passing arguments to functions). Pointers and managing dynamic memory in C. Comparing the runtime performance of Python and C implementations of algorithms.
